## Abstract

Massively multiplayer online (MMO) games are multiplayer games featuring a huge amount of player living in a persistent virtual world. In MMO games the player's experience is mainly influenced by the size and details of the virtual world. Technically the bigger the world is, the bigger is the time the player takes to explore all the places. This work proposes a tool able to generate coastlines for pseudo-infinite virtual worlds with different types of terrain. Using a combination of algorithms and content management methods, such as Perlin noise, the tool is able to create beaches, islands, bays and costlines that imitate the real world landscapes. One of the contributions of the tool is the ability to generate pieces of land focusing on the coastline generation. The development of the present work aimed to handle separately the generation of content for all elements in the world (continents, terrains, etc.). The main point in the work is the coastline generation, not the content inside the continents.
